/**
 * Merges multiple props objects, intelligently handling refs, event handlers,
 * and class names.
 *
 * - Refs: Supports both callback and object refs, merging them appropriately.
 * - Event Handlers: Chains multiple handlers for the same event.
 * - aria-describedby/aria-labelledby: Merges IDs to reference multiple elements
 *   for accessibility.
 * - className: Uses cx to concatenate classes.
 * - Inline styles and classNames objects: Performs shallow merge.
 *
 *   Note: Conflicts are resolved by preferring the last value provided for a
 *   given key, except for specific merge rules.
